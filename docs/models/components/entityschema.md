# EntitySchema

The JSON schema definition of the entity generated by an instruction. The schema must define an `object` at its root. If the instruction is expected to generate multiple items, the root object should have a key which defines an array of the expected items. An instruction which generates multiple emails may be expressed as `{"type": "object", "properties": {"emails": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string"}}}}`. Simple values may be expressed as an object with a single key. For example, a summary instruction may generate a single string value. The schema might be `{"type": "object", "properties": { "summary": { "type": "string"}}}`.
